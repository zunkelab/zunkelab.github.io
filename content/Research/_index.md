        **Research Focus**  
        We study lysosomal dysfunction and its impact on the aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn), a hallmark of Parkinsonâ€™s disease (PD), exploring how these molecular events contribute to cellular and tissue pathology.  
        We investigate the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) as both biomarkers and mediators of disease, analyzing their protein and RNA content in accessible biofluids (such as blood and saliva) to detect disease-specific alterations. We are part of the Erlangen Vesicle Initiative ([EVI](https://www.evi.forschung.fau.de/research-groups/zunke-lab/)).  
        Through proteomics, genomics, and a broad set of biochemical assays, we identify altered pathways and mechanisms, especially those related to degradation processes, protein aggregation, and lipid metabolism.  
        Our work is highly translational, aiming to devise treatment strategies targeting the cellular degradative system and to develop reliable biomarkers for disease diagnosis and progression.  

        **Research Methods and Models**  
        We combine advanced techniques, including state-of-the-art protein biochemical approaches such as recombinant protein expression, together with proteomic and lipidomic profiling as well as seed amplification assays to detect pathological protein conformers.  
        Further, we utilize cell lines, primary murine cells, and patient-derived iPSC models to link basic molecular findings to potential clinical applications.  

        **Our Mission: Translational Applications!**  
        By mapping PD-associated molecular signatures in extracellular vesicles and cellular pathways, we seek to understand molecular mechanisms of disease pathology in order to reliably establish biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This will facilitate early diagnosis and the development of personalized treatments.
