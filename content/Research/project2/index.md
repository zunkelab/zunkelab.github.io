Astrocytes are among the most abundant cell types in the brain and are known to carry out a wide range of essential functions, including maintaining the blood–brain barrier, modulating dopaminergic transmission, and influencing synaptic signalling. Despite this, our understanding of how astrocytes behave in pathological conditions—and more specifically, how they may support or suppress disease progression—remains limited.  

The aim of the *AstroFinder* project is to elucidate the role of astrocytes across various brain pathologies, including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson’s disease (PD), glioblastoma, epilepsy, multiple system atrophy (MSA), and a range of immunogenic states in murine models. A key goal is to identify distinct astrocytic phenotypes, e.g. by characterizing their gene expression patterns. Through this, we aim to determine whether astrocytes themselves could serve as therapeutic targets. For instance, reinforcing and stabilizing beneficial astrocytic functions may provide a novel strategy to support the body’s intrinsic repair and resistance mechanisms, potentially offering an alternative to purely pharmacological interventions aimed at eradicating disease-driving elements.  

To achieve this, the project brings together several expert groups—including the labs of Rothhammer, Zunke, Heiland, Winner, Rosshart, and Beckervordersandforth-Bonk—each contributing specialized knowledge in different disease models. The research approach involves comprehensive spatial transcriptomic analyses of established murine disease models, examination of patient samples, translation of findings into hiPSC-derived astrocyte models, and quantitative evaluation of key proteins and genes using biochemical and molecular methods.
