Lysosomal proteostasis plays a critical role in modulating α-synuclein turnover and aggregate clearance in synucleinopathies such as Parkinson’s disease and multiple system atrophy.  

This project investigates the functional relationship between lysosomal proteases, particularly **cathepsins**, and the aggregation of α-synuclein in iPSC-derived neuronal and oligodendroglial models of synucleinopathy.  

Beyond mechanistic insights, the project explores strategies to **enhance lysosomal activity** in a translational approach. The aim is to reduce toxic protein aggregation and pave the way for therapeutic applications targeting lysosomal degradation pathways in neurodegenerative diseases.
