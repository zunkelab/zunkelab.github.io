This project aims to tackle Parkinson’s disease from two complementary aspects: understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers that enable early and accurate diagnosis.  

Induced pluripotent stem cell–derived dopaminergic neuron models are used to study how accumulation and aggregation of the disease-associated protein α-synuclein influence lysosomal processes, and how these alterations can be restored to ameliorate disease pathology.  

A central focus lies on **extracellular vesicles (EVs)**. We investigate their role both as biomarkers and mediators of disease by analyzing their protein and RNA content in accessible biofluids (such as blood and saliva) to detect disease-specific alterations. As part of the **Erlangen Vesicle Initiative** ([EVI](https://www.evi.forschung.fau.de/research-groups/zunke-lab/)), we contribute to collaborative efforts to translate EV biology into reliable diagnostic tools.  

Through proteomic and genomic profiling, seed amplification assays, and biochemical approaches, this project seeks to map PD-associated molecular signatures and identify translationally relevant targets. Ultimately, the goal is to establish robust biomarkers and therapeutic strategies that support early diagnosis and personalized treatment of Parkinson’s disease.
