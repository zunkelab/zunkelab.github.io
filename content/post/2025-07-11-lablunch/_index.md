This year we celebrated our traditional **International Lab Lunch** 🎉.  
Everyone in the group brought a dish from their home country or culture – from homemade sweets to savory specialties and even some fun fusion creations.  

It was not only about enjoying delicious food, but also about exchanging stories, learning about different traditions, and spending time together outside the lab.  

We are already looking forward to next year’s Lab Lunch 🍴🌍💛
