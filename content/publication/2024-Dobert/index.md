abstract: |
  This study demonstrates that overexpression of LIMP-2 enhances lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) activity, even rescuing pathogenic variants like E326K, via a peptide mimicking GCase–LIMP-2 interaction. Useful for both purification and therapeutic activation strategies in Gaucher’s and Parkinson’s diseases. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
summary: LIMP-2 overexpression and interaction peptide increase GCase activity; a promising therapeutic avenue in GD/PD.
