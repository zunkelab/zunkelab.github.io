abstract: |
  Detecting neuron-derived pathological α-synuclein in blood holds potential for non-invasive Parkinson’s disease diagnostics. This study demonstrates that α-synuclein aggregates can be isolated from neuron-derived exosomes in patient plasma with high specificity and sensitivity, marking a promising step toward liquid biopsy biomarkers.
summary: Neuron-derived αSyn aggregates reliably isolated from blood exosomes—possible Parkinson’s disease biomarkers.
