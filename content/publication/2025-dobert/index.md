abstract: |
  Using cryo-electron microscopy, this study resolves the structure of the β-glucocerebrosidase (GCase)–LIMP-2 complex at high resolution, detailing the interaction interface and conservation of critical helices and loops. These insights reveal mechanism of lysosomal enzyme trafficking and have implications for therapeutic modulation in Parkinson’s disease and Gaucher’s disease.
summary: High-res cryo-TEM structure of the GCase–LIMP-2 complex reveals key elements of lysosomal enzyme transport.
