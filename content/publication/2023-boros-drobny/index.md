abstract: |
  Lysosomal dysfunction has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson’s. This study reveals impaired lysosomal trafficking of cathepsins in patient-derived neurons and mouse models with αSyn aggregation, leading to reduced enzyme activity. A farnesyltransferase inhibitor enhanced cathepsin maturation and αSyn clearance, demonstrating a link between aggregation and lysosomal clearance.
summary: Impaired lysosomal trafficking of cathepsins in αSyn aggregation models; pharmacological rescue of degradation pathways.
