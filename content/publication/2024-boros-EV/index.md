abstract: |
  This study evaluates α-synuclein seed amplification assays (SAA) from extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from blood of Parkinson’s disease patients, demonstrating that EVs are reliable sources for α-synuclein detection. These findings support the use of blood-derived EVs as a minimally invasive biomarker for early PD diagnosis.
summary: EV-derived α-synuclein assays reliably detect pathological seeds—promising non-invasive biomarker approach.
