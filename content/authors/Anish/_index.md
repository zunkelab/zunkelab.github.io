Anish Varghese completed his Integrated Bachelors and Masters in Biology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Thiruvananthapuram, India. For his master’s thesis, he worked on a project to study the effect of post-translational modifications on alpha-synuclein fibril formation and its implications for Parkinson’s disease pathology. 

In 2023, he moved to Germany and joined the Department of Molecular Neurology, University Hospital Erlangen, as a doctoral researcher in the group of Prof. Dr. Friederike Zunke. His current work focuses on the role of lysosomal dysfunction and alpha-synuclein aggregation in oligodendrocyte development and myelination, using cellular and animal models of multiple system atrophy. 

Outside the lab, he enjoys finding new and interesting books, experimenting with different recipes, and—more recently—embracing the hiking craze like a true German local.
