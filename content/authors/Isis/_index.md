Isis Trzan is a Brazilian biomedical scientist with a background in clinical analysis, molecular biology, and immunology. She holds a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Sciences from UESC (Brazil) and a Master's degree in Immunology from the University of São Paulo (USP, Brazil). In 2023, she moved to Germany to pursue a PhD in the Department of Molecular Neurology at Uniklinikum FAU in Erlangen. Her research focuses on gut-brain communication in Parkinson’s disease (PD), with a particular interest in the mechanisms driving intestinal alpha-synuclein aggregation. 

Beyond the lab, Isis enjoys running, dancing, and discovering new landscapes through travel and exploration.
