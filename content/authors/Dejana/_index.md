Dejana Taneva Hristov completed her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Biology at Paisii Hilendarski University in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, where she also trained as a teacher in Biology, Chemistry, and Physics. For her bachelor’s thesis, she investigated the total toxic effect, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity of pesticides on the plant test system *Pisum sativum L.*, and graduated with a final grade of 1.7.  

After moving to Germany, she received recognition as a health and nursing professional and subsequently worked as a nurse in neurology, before transitioning into roles as a medical technical laboratory assistant (MTLA) in several clinical and research settings. From 2020 until the end of 2022, she worked in Medical Clinic 1 (Research Gastroenterology, Pneumology, and Endocrinology) at the University Hospital Erlangen.  

Since 2024, Dejana has been working as a study nurse in the Department of Molecular Neurology at the University Hospital Erlangen, where she supports clinical and translational research projects. She has also completed additional training in animal experimentation (FELASA and IÄTA).  

Outside of work, Dejana enjoys playing piano, drawing, exploring new places, and spending time with friends and family.
