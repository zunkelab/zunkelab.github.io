Fanni is a postdoctoral researcher with a focus on elucidating the pathomechanisms, and identifying novel biomarkers for Parkinson´s disease. 

She completed medical doctor training at the University of Szeged, Hungary and received her MD diploma in 2016. After completing her university studies, she entered a Clinical and Experimental Neurosciences PhD program at the same university. During her PhD Fanni studied the possible molecular causes of Parkinson’s disease, with the aim to help a better understanding of the genetic background and underlying molecular mechanisms with a special focus on long non-coding RNAs.

After defending her PhD thesis in 2021, first for a short time she worked as a junior research fellow in the Neurogenetics Laboratory of the Department of Neurology at the Albert Szent-Györgyi Medical School of the University of Szeged. In 2022 she moved to Germany to pursue a postdoc position in the Zunke lab. 

With her research, Fanni aims at tackling Parkinson´s disease from two aspects: on one hand she wants to contribute to gaining a better understanding of the disease pathomechanisms. On the other hand her goal is to identify disease biomarkers which would enable early and accurate diagnosis. For the former she is using in vitro induced pluripotent stem-cell derived dopaminergic neuron-models of the disease. With the use of these cellular models she is studying how accumulation and aggregation of the disease-associated protein, alpha-synuclein influence lysosomal processes, and how these alterations can be restored in order to ameliorate disease pathology. In search for a disease biomarker, her work focuses on extracellular vesicles (EVs). For this she established protocols for the isolation and characterization of EVs from various biofluids, and she is analyzing the content of these vesicles in search for molecular signatures characteristic of Parkinson´s disease.

In her free time Fanni enjoys spending time in nature, let it be in a form of a run, bike ride, or just a long walk. She also likes travelling and visiting new places, especially when accompanied by her friends and family.
