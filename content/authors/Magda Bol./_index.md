description: |
  Magdalena has earned both her BSc and MSc in Molecular Medicine, while pursuing her medical studies in parallel at the Friedrich-Alexander-University Erlangen-Nürnberg. She is currently completing her final year of medical school within the standard duration of the program. She obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Medicine, carrying out her thesis in the Spuler Lab at the Muscle Research Unit of the Charité Berlin, where she worked on the characterization of a humanized mouse model for limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. She continued in the consecutive Master’s program, conducting her thesis in the Zunke Lab, where she investigated the role of the astrocytic lysosomal system in α-synuclein pathology.

  Her academic path also included international research stays. At the University College London, in the Lab of Anthony Schapira, she explored the contribution of lipid droplets to familial forms of Parkinson’s disease. She then joined the laboratories of Dennis Selkoe and Ulf Dettmer at Harvard Medical School, where she studied the physiological role of phosphorylated α-synuclein (pS129) and the impact of lipid droplet accumulation on endogenous α-synuclein.

  She is currently pursuing her MD thesis in the Zunke Lab, investigating the role of cathepsins in viral entry mechanisms. Alongside this, she contributes to projects exploring the lysosomal system of astrocytes across various models of α-synucleinopathies. Alongside her path as an early-career neuroscientist and future neurologist, she balances her scientific endeavors with a love for hiking, cycling on her racing bike, and enjoying good food in great company.
