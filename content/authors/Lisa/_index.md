Lisa obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Medicine at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2022. For her Bachelor’s thesis, she joined the Zunke Lab, where she investigated Parkinson’s disease with a focus on the interaction between the lysosomal enzyme Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and its transporter protein LIMP-2. Using a cloned LIMP-2 peptide and other experimental approaches, she helped delineate the molecular structure and interaction domains of these two proteins.

Afterwards, she completed several internships in diverse research environments. In the Jantsch Lab at the University of Regensburg, she examined the interplay between Salmonella and macrophages, with particular emphasis on the immunometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. She then joined the Wenger Lab at Charité Berlin, contributing to research on spinal cord stimulation and its potential to ameliorate gait impairments in Parkinson’s disease. Her scientific training also led her to Panama City, where she worked under the supervision of Ivonne Torres at the Universidad de Panamá and gained hands-on experience in inflammasome biology.
