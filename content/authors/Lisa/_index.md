Lisa obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Medicine from the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in 2022. For her thesis, she worked in the Zunke Lab, where she investigated Parkinson’s disease with a particular focus on the interaction between the lysosomal enzyme Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and its transporter protein LIMP-2. Her experimental work, including the use of a cloned LIMP-2 peptide, contributed to uncovering the molecular structure and interaction domains of the two proteins.

Following this, she completed a series of internships in diverse research environments. In the Jantsch Lab at the University of Regensburg, she studied the interaction between Salmonella, macrophages, focusing on the immunometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. She then joined the Wenger Lab at Charité in Berlin, where she worked on spinal cord stimulation and its potential to improve gait impairments in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Her research journey also took her to Panama City, where she trained under the supervision of Ivonne Torres at the Universidad de Panamá, gaining experience in inflammasome biology.

Lisa is currently enrolled in medical school and conducted her MD research in the Department of Hemato-Oncology at the University Hospital Erlangen under the supervision of Prof. Fabian Müller. There, she designed promoter constructs aimed at addressing current challenges in CAR-T cell therapy.

In April 2024, she rejoined the Zunke Lab, where she is now engaged in a translational research project exploring the role of astrocytes across a wide range of brainpathologies, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, glioblastoma, epilepsy, multiple system atrophy, and various immunogenic states in murine models.
