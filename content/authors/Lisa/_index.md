Lisa obtained her Bachelor’s degree in Molecular Medicine from the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen–Nürnberg in 2022. For her thesis, she worked in the Zunke Lab, where she investigated Parkinson’s disease with a focus on the interaction between the lysosomal enzyme Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) and its transporter protein LIMP-2. Her work, including the utilization of a cloned LIMP-2 peptide, contributed to characterizing the structural interaction domains between the two proteins.

She subsequently completed internships in diverse research environments. In the Jantsch Lab at the University of Regensburg, she investigated the interaction between *Salmonella* and macrophages, with a particular focus on the immunometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. She then joined the Wenger Lab at Charité Berlin, where she worked on spinal cord stimulation and its potential to ameliorate gait impairments in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Her research journey also included international training at the Universidad de Panamá under the supervision of Ivonne Torres, where she gained experience in inflammasome biology.

Alongside her medical studies, Lisa is completing her MSc in Molecular Medicine. Her master's thesis in the Department of Hemato-Oncology at the University Hospital Erlangen, supervised by Prof. Fabian Müller, focused on the design of promoter constructs to address current challenges in CAR-T cell therapy.

Since April 2024, she has rejoined the Zunke Lab and is now contributing to translational research projects centered on astrocytic lysosomal biology and α-synuclein pathology. Her MD thesis, conducted in collaboration with the Zunke, Rothhammer and Beckervordersandforth Lab, investigates astrocyte reactivity states across species using a multiomics approach. 

Lisa currently works as the Scientific Coordinator of the SYNERGY AstroFinder (DAFNE) project, which aims to decode the role of astrocytes across neuropathologies in a translational context. She has a growing interest in spatial omics technologies as well as hiPSC-based modeling of neurodegenerative diseases.
