Robin started working in service-related roles in 2013, obtaining his first certification as an Associate Engineer in collaboration with a dual study programme in 2016. He then went on to obtain a Bachelor of Engineering in electrical engineering with a focus on electronic systems at Beuth University of Applied Sciences Berlin in 2018 by developing a current terminal adjustment adapter for use as an adjustment test system in his bachelor’s thesis. Further work introduced him to REFA basic training in process analysis and statistical data analysis.  

Subsequent roles involved automating programmes and workflows, culminating in cloud database management analysis, developing web input masks and automation of management processes.  

In 2022, he began a second bachelor's degree in Molecular Medicine at FAU Erlangen, and is currently working on his bachelor's thesis, which involves analysing the cellular uptake, viability and lysosomal function of SH-SY5Y cells in the context of α-synuclein-induced neurodegenerative diseases using LIMP-2-derived peptides.  

Outside the lab, Robin is a sports enthusiast who enjoys swimming, climbing and playing beach volleyball. He loves cooking, eating and travelling to natural places in his free time.
