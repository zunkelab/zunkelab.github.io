Friederike Zunke is a neuroscientist specialized in the molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Parkinson’s disease and related synucleinopathies. She obtained her Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at the University of Kiel as well as St George’s University in London, respectively. Following, she pursued her academic training in biochemistry at the University of Kiel, earning her PhD in 2015 with a focus on lysosomal dysfunction in neurodegeneration. She furthered her research as a postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University in Chicago, concentrating on lysosomal and lipid pathways and alpha-synuclein aggregation processes. 

In the end of 2016, Zunke returned to Kiel as an independent group leader at the Institute of Biochemistry, where she and her group studied the impact of lysosomal proteases on the degradation of the alpha-synuclein protein. By 2020, she was appointed as a junior professor for translational neurosciences at the Department of Molecular Neurology, at the University Hospital Erlangen / Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg. Since 2025 she is full professor and deputy head of the Department. Her research employs biochemical, cellular, and structural analyses to explore protein-protein interactions, aggregation and degradation pathways, with a particular emphasis on lysosomal function and homeostasis. Further, she is eager in identifying biomarkers for early detection of the Parkinson’s disease. For this her group has developed key assays for purification of extracellular vesicles from biofluids of patients.

Outside the laboratory, Friederike is passionate about sports and food (cooking and eating!). She enjoys playing tennis with her team, going for a run, and cycling in the Franconian Switzerland on her cyclocross-bike.
